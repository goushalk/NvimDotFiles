# NvimDotFiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). It includes settings, plugins, and custom scripts to enhance the Neovim experience for efficient coding and editing.

## Features

- Modular configuration structure for easy customization
- Plugin management (e.g., with Packer, Lazy, or other plugin managers)
- Custom key mappings
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration
- Syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and linting
- Theming and UI enhancements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (version 0.5 or higher recommended)
- Git
- Additional dependencies as required by specific plugins (refer to plugin documentation as needed)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/goushalk/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim

2. **Install plugins:**

   Open Neovim and run the appropriate command for your plugin manager. For example, if using [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):
